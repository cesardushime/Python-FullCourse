#similar to list while storing values, but can't be modified once defined. Unlike lists, where we use square brackets, we use parantheses.

numbers = (1, 2, 3, 6, 5, 3, 5)
#print(numbers.count(5))

#unpacking feature in python. It works both on tuples and lists
coordinates = (1, 2, 3)
x, y, z = coordinates
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
